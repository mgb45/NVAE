# Newtonian VAE

A NewtonianVAE learns a linear latent dynamic model from high dimensional data, such that proportionality holds in the latent space. The notebook [Pointmass_demo](Pointmass_demo.ipynb) provides a minimum working example of a Newtonian VAE trained on images of a point mass, along with latent space visualisation during training.
